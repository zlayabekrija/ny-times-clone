This project is the collaboration of [Zlatan](https://github.com/zlayabekrija) & [Inzi](https://github.com/inhaq). [Preview this project](https://zlayabekrija.github.io/ny-times-clone/)

To enhance and practive our HTML5/CSS3 knowledge, we cloned design of NY Times. In the process we improved our collaboration skills, learned floats, positioning, box model, layout.

We started with header and fixed it to the top, to scroll with viewport. Then we divided the content section into two parts, article and sidebar. Both of them are floated left and right respectively. And cleared both of these floated elements. Next part is footer, where we used float to made images looks appropriate and aligned. Footer has also two sections, articles data with images, title and sub-title, while on right side there is only article titles. These both sections are also aligned with floats.
